            <h3>How long before the exit you must be planning it?</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>Is it viable now for IT companies to file an IPO?</h3>

            <h3>Bringing a new CFO at the time of crisis?</h3>
            <p>

Hiring a new Chief Financial Officer may seem like an obvious managerial solution from that list.
But actually, is it the best decision?
